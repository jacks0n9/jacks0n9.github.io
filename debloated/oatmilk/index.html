    <h1>How to Make Oat Milk</h1>
    <p>By Adam and Joanne Gallagher</p>
    <p>Prep: 5mins Total: 5mins</p>
    <p>Makes about 3 cups</p>
    <h2>You will need:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup rolled oats</li>
        <li>4 cups cold water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the oats and cold water and any optional ingredients to a blender. Cover with the lid and blend for 30 to 40 seconds. Itâ€™s okay if you see little speckles of oats. It is best not to over blend since it can cause a slimy texture.</li>
        <li>Strain the oat milk. This is best done with a nut milk bag, clean cotton dish towel or multiple layers of cheese cloth that has been set over a large bowl or pitcher.</li>
        <li>For the best results, double strain the mixture so that most of the solids are removed.</li>
        <li>Store homemade oat milk in a sealed container and store up to a week in the fridge. Shake or stir before using.</li>
    </ol>
